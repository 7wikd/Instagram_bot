# Contributing

- Want to contribute to [Insta_bot](https://github.com/7wikd/Insta_bot)? I'm counting on you guys to help me grow this too!

- Here is a basic outline on opening issues and making PRs:

## Opening Issues

- Search for your problem in the [Issues Section](https://github.com/7wikd/Insta_bot/issues) before opening a new ticket. 
  It might be already answered and save both you and me time.

- Provide as much information as possible when opening your ticket, including any relevant examples (if any)

- If you think your question is naive or something and you can't find anything related, don't feel bad. Open an issue any way!

## Making Pull Requests

- Look up for open issues and see if you can help out there.

- When making a PR, point it to the [master branch](https://github.com/7wikd/Insta_bot/tree/master) unless mentioned otherwise.(Well that didn't age well, did it?)

- If you are planning to work on something big, let me know through an issue. So we can discuss more about it.
- Lastly, please don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions!

Let me know (through an issue) if you are facing any trouble making a PR, I'd be glad to help you out!
